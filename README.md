**PlanetLabs Coding Challenge - RESTful web service**

## Setup

### Python
Anaconda's Python distribution is recomended for getting started. Easiest way to get started is to install and create a new Python 3.6 environment from the included `environment.yml` file. http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html.

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Otherwise, if you don't have Anaconda, a working Python 3.6+ environment with a few ancilarly modules is all you need. Consult `environment.yml` for a list of all modules and install however you're most comfortable.

### Clone

```
git clone git@github.com:ZachDischner/smartypy.git
```

### Start the Application
App datatabase is all in-memory using native Python data structures, so no need to install or start a database service. Just start the app:

```python
python app.py
```

## Using the App
